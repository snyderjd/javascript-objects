You have volunteered your time to a local political candidate, Elizabeth Sanger, who wants to become a US representative in Congress for your district.Unfortunately, the team discovered that you're a software developer, so they have begged you to build an application that lets them track volunteers, and store information about Elizabeth and her campaign.
